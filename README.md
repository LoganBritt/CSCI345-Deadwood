# CSCI345-Deadwood
This is the repository that contains the code for the game Deadwood

It currently contains the Classes for the game. They have practically no use.
Deadwood.java is the startup executable for the game. Running Deadwood.java starts the game. 

It currently only calls the main function for each other class to test compilation of each.
Each class provides a quick description of each class and it's general purpose.
